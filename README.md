# WWCode Dev Summit BlockDataPy 2023

I presented a talk, _**Using Better Visualisations to Elevate Your Data Insights**_, at the WWCode Dev Summit: BlockDataPy 2023! 

I talked about creating impactful charts and graphs for enhanced data understanding, best practices for selecting suitable chart types, 
utilising colors harmoniously, and incorporating informative labeling.
